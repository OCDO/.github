## Welcome to OCDO! :wave:

The Open Crystallographic Defects Ontologies is an initiative that aims to develop standard and interoperable semantics describing crystal defects and adjacent topics such as simulation concepts.

### Ontologies

* **CDOS - Crystallographic Defect Ontology Suite** 
  * CDCO - Crystallographic Defect Core Ontology
  * PODO - Point Defect Ontology
  * LDO - Line Defect Ontology
    * DISO - Dislocation Ontology
  * PLDO - Plane Defect Ontology

* **MMSS - Materials Modelling and Simulation Suite**
  * ASMO - Atomistic Simulation Methods Ontology
  * D3SIM - Discrete Dislocation Dynamics Simulation	

* **CMSO -  Computational Materials Sample Ontology**

### Contributing

OCDO welcomes contributions from domain experts in order to improve the ontologies. 
Feel free to contact us or provide suggestions in a new issue regarding new terms, definitions, synonyms or mapping to relevant ontologies.

### How to use
